This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a dependency array that includes a function.  The function might be recreated on every render, leading to infinite loops or unexpected behavior. This is because React's dependency tracking compares references, and a new function reference is created on every render, even if the function's logic remains the same.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    // ...
  };
  fetchData();
}, [fetchData]); // Incorrect: fetchData changes on every render
```
